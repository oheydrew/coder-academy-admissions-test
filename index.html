    <h2>This is the first title - Hi! I'm Drew!</h2>
    <p class="paragraph-one">Hey there, I'm Drew. I'm a thirtysomething audio engineer who's decided to jump into a new career as a software engineer! I'm into lots of things besides tech- music (being an audio engineer, that's a given ðŸ˜‰), fire-twirling/poi spinning, photography & video, festivals, food, and my cat ðŸ˜º </p>

        <h3> What has drawn you to coding? </h3>
        <p class="paragraph-two">I'm currently an audio engineer, and whilst I still enjoy the work I do, I've been doing it over a decade and have decided it's time for a change. Since I first started exploring the world of software development I've been hooked by many aspects of the industry; from the technical work itself, to the challenges and problem solving, right through to the culture of the workplaces and it's people.</p>

    <h3> What do you hope for from the course? </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-three">The main thing I aim to achieve from the course is to gain usable skills. I aim to learn and understand coding concepts as well as ops concepts, with the intention of finding work and beginning a career in web development. Ultimately, I'd love to work on embedded systems and devices, but I'm also really interested in web-dev and interfaces.</p>

    <h3> What do you hope to do after the course? </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-four">I plan to attend many events and networking opportunities whilst at the course, but I also intend to continue that afterwards. I have full intentions of throwing myself into the job search, hoping to land myself a junior supported position, likely with a larger company where I can work and contribute, whilst learning with support.</p>
